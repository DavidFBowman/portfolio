A small sample of my code for interested parties.

-Red Pitaya

This was written as part of the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate at Royal Holloway.
It is a set of drivers used to control a Red Pitaya signal generation and acquisition board in order to diagnose faults in the transducers of medical particle acclerators.
The core of the code is provided by the manufacturer and adapted by myself to be used as a pre-compiled python library.
These tools can then be used alongside the SQLite functions to maintain a database of the transducer output for analysis.
This project is conducted in C, Python, SQLite and SWIG.

-Phonons

A Python class used as part of my PhD to analyse the output of ab-intio calculations and compare them with experimental data.

-Monte Carlo Clustering

Python tools for generating clustered defects in a virtual crystal to be used in computational diffraction experiments.
The clusters are formed using a simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm.

-Bioinformatics

Python tools developed as part of the Coursera course Bioinformatics for analysis of DNA strings of bacteria and genomes.

-Machine Learning

One week of material writen in MATLAB covering using K means clustering for image compression developed as part of the Coursera course on Machine Learning.
Read the README in the directory to see which parts I wrote and which were provided by the course.
Executing ex7.m will show the image compression algorithm working on the file bird_small.png

Additional ML code can be provided on request showing support vector machines, neural networks and a range of other ML algorithms and techniques.
